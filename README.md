# Audible Cover Grabber

This is a very very basic browser extension to grab high resolution cover images for any Audible book using the API. It might be expanded on in the future, but for now it's just a simple single image download tool.

## Installation Instructions

This extension has built versions for all major browsers except Safari, however I only really tested it with Chrome so I'm only going to include instructions for that. If you want to try it out with another browser, you can download one of the other release options and give it a shot!

1. Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/book-tools/audible-cover-grabber/releases).
2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `audible-cover-grabber-<browser>`.
3. Put this folder in a place where you won't touch it. Chrome will always access it from that location once you load it in, so don't move it once it's been added to Chrome.
4. In Chrome go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
5. Enable "Developer Mode" by toggling the switch in the top right of the page.
6. Drag the `audible-cover-grabber-<browser>` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards). Alternatively, you can click "Load Unpacked Extension" and locate the folder using your file browser.

And that's it! If you have any trouble, feel free to leave an issue on this repo.

###

Every time you open Chrome it may warn you about running extensions in developer mode, just click &#10005; to keep the extension enabled.
